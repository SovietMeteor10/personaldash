    "content": "# Perpetual Contracts Market for Prediction Markets: Technical Feasibility Analysis\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report analyzes the technical feasibility of building perpetual contracts markets for Polymarket and Kalshi events on Hyperliquid. While technically possible, significant challenges exist around oracle design, settlement mechanisms, and regulatory compliance. Several competitors are exploring similar concepts, but no mature implementation exists specifically for prediction market perpetuals.\n\n## Background\n\n### Understanding the Components\n\n**Perpetual Contracts**: Financial derivatives without expiration dates that track underlying asset prices through funding rate mechanisms. Originally popularized in cryptocurrency trading, they maintain price parity with spot markets through periodic funding payments between long and short positions.\n\n**Prediction Markets**: \n- **Polymarket**: Decentralized prediction market on Polygon allowing binary outcome betting\n- **Kalshi**: CFTC-regulated prediction market for US users offering event contracts\n\n**Hyperliquid**: High-performance decentralized exchange specializing in perpetual futures with an order book model and integrated automated market maker.\n\n### Market Opportunity\n\nTraditional prediction markets suffer from:\n- Limited liquidity depth\n- High spreads on popular events  \n- Capital inefficiency (full collateralization required)\n- No leverage or sophisticated trading strategies\n\n## Technical Feasibility Analysis\n\n### Core Architecture Requirements\n\n#### 1. Oracle Integration\n**Critical Challenge**: Bridging prediction market outcomes to perpetual contract pricing\n\n**Technical Requirements**:\n- Real-time price feeds from Polymarket/Kalshi APIs\n- Robust oracle network (potentially Chainlink, Pyth, or custom solution)\n- Handling of market resolution delays and disputes\n- Price aggregation mechanisms for illiquid prediction markets\n\n```solidity\n// Conceptual Oracle Interface\ninterface IPredictionOracle {\n    function getMarketPrice(bytes32 marketId) external view returns (uint256);\n    function getMarketResolution(bytes32 marketId) external view returns (bool resolved, uint8 outcome);\n    function updatePrice(bytes32 marketId, uint256 price) external;\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Funding Rate Mechanism\n**Technical Implementation**:\n- Funding rate = (Perpetual Price - Oracle Price) / Time Interval\n- 8-hour funding cycles (standard practice)\n- Cap funding rates to prevent manipulation (typically ±2.5%)\n\n#### 3. Settlement Logic\n**Binary Event Handling**:\n- YES tokens → settle to $1.00\n- NO tokens → settle to $0.00\n- Multi-outcome events require more complex settlement\n\n#### 4. Risk Management\n- Position limits based on open interest\n- Circuit breakers for unusual price movements\n- Liquidation mechanisms for leveraged positions\n\n### Integration with Hyperliquid\n\n#### Advantages\n- **High Performance**: 20,000+ TPS capability\n- **Native Perpetuals Infrastructure**: Built-in funding rate mechanisms\n- **Integrated AMM**: Provides baseline liquidity\n- **Developer SDK**: Robust APIs for market creation\n\n#### Technical Integration Points\n\n```typescript\n// Hyperliquid Integration Example\nimport { Hyperliquid } from '@hyperliquid/sdk';\n\nclass PredictionPerpetual {\n  constructor(private hl: Hyperliquid) {}\n  \n  async createMarket(predictionMarketId: string, initialPrice: number) {\n    return await this.hl.exchange.createPerpetual({\n      symbol: `PRED_${predictionMarketId}`,\n      initialPrice,\n      fundingRate: this.calculateInitialFunding(),\n      maxLeverage: 10\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Competitive Landscape Analysis\n\n### Direct Competitors\n\n#### 1. **dYdX Prediction Markets** (Announced 2023)\n- **Status**: Development phase\n- **Approach**: Native prediction perpetuals on dYdX v4\n- **Advantages**: Established infrastructure, high liquidity\n- **Limitations**: Limited to binary outcomes, closed ecosystem\n\n#### 2. **Drift Protocol** (Exploring)\n- **Status**: Research phase\n- **Approach**: Prediction markets as synthetic assets\n- **Focus**: Solana-based implementation\n\n#### 3. **SynFutures** (V3 roadmap)\n- **Status**: Roadmap item\n- **Approach**: Synthetic prediction assets\n- **Limitations**: Not specifically targeting existing prediction markets\n\n### Adjacent Competitors\n\n#### Traditional Prediction Market Enhancements\n- **Polymarket V2**: Improved liquidity mechanisms\n- **Kalshi Pro**: Professional trading features\n- **Augur Turbo**: Faster settlement mechanisms\n\n### Market Gap Analysis\n\n**Unaddressed Opportunities**:\n- Cross-platform prediction market arbitrage\n- Leveraged prediction market exposure\n- Sophisticated trading strategies (spreads, straddles)\n- Institutional-grade prediction market access\n\n## Technical Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP Development (Weeks 1-8)\n\n#### Core Components\n1. **Oracle Service**\n   ```python\n   # Price feed aggregator\n   class PredictionOracle:\n       async def fetch_polymarket_price(self, market_id):\n           # CLOB API integration\n       \n       async def fetch_kalshi_price(self, event_id):\n           # Kalshi API integration\n       \n       async def aggregate_prices(self, sources):\n           # Weighted average with outlier detection\n   ```\n\n2. **Smart Contract Architecture**\n   -
